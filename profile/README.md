# Ocean Monitoring Gateway (OMG)

We are a collaborative and multidisciplinary research team bringing together scientists from [LIRMM-CNRS](https://www.lirmm.fr/lirmm-en/) (Laboratory of Informatics, Robotics, and Microelectronics, Montpellier) and [Ifremer](https://www.ifremer.fr/en) (French Research Institute for the Exploitation of the Sea). We design and develop open-source hardware and software solutions for the observation and understanding of wildlife, ecosystems, and biodiversity.
